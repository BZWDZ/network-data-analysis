Completion of Part 1, Task B

3.18  
Completion of Part 1, Task C  
Implemented plausibility score function and prioritization logic for suspicious users  

3.20  
Completion of Part 1, Task D  
Compared networks in terms of topology and diffusion; discussed network quality and potential issues  

3.22  
Start of Part 2, Task A  
Downloaded Leeds road network and accident datasets; selected study area with KDE  

3.24  
Completion of Task A analysis  
Calculated network size, density, circuitry and planarity characteristics  

3.26  
Completion of Part 2, Task B  
Visualized accident distribution, computed K-function and Moran’s I  

3.28  
Completion of relative accident location analysis  
Confirmed clustering of accidents near intersections  

3.29  
Start of Part 2, Task C  
Constructed full Leeds road graph and defined Voronoi seed points  

4.1  
Edge-based Voronoi diagram completed  
Assigned edges to Voronoi cells and visualized cells  

4.2  
Path search attempt for 42km loop in 4 cells  
Found no cell had valid route within target length  

4.4  
Optimization attempt: reduced seed points from 4 → 2  
Regenerated Voronoi regions and repeated path search (still unsuccessful)  

4.5  
Completion of Part 2, Task C  
Documented optimization strategy and results with code output  
Started Part 2, Task D: PROV modeling and PageRank computation
